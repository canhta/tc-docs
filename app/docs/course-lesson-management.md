    MaintainCourseTrajectory(studentPlanID)
ELSE IF (statusId == AttendanceStatus.NoShow) THEN
    FlagProgressConcern(studentPlanID)
    TriggerInterventionWorkflow(studentPlanID)
    AdjustCompletionTimeline(studentPlanID)
ELSE IF (statusId == AttendanceStatus.Excused) THEN
    MaintainProgressStatus(studentPlanID)
    ScheduleMakeUpOpportunity(studentPlanID)
END IF

Business Justification:

- Early Intervention: Identifies at-risk students for additional support
- Quality Standards: Maintains course completion requirements
- Progress Accuracy: Provides realistic progress tracking based on actual participation
```

#### **Advanced Lesson Reservation & Resource Management**
```
Business Logic: ReserveLesson(studentPlanId, reserveUID, groupId, refId, studentId)

Lesson Reservation Orchestration:

ReserveLesson(studentPlanId, reserveUID, groupId, refId, studentId):

IF (groupId > 0) THEN
    ValidateGroupCapacity(groupId, studentId)
    CheckGroupScheduleConflicts(groupId, studentPlanId)
    AllocateGroupResources(groupId, reserveUID)
ELSE
    ValidateIndividualAvailability(studentId, studentPlanId)
    AllocateIndividualResources(studentPlanId, reserveUID)
END IF

UpdateReservationStatus(reserveUID, "Reserved")

- Equipment Assignment: Allocates required instruments and technology
- Material Preparation: Ensures lesson materials are available and prepared
- Teacher Coordination: Confirms teacher availability and preparation requirements
```

### 4.2 Course Creation & Approval Workflow

#### **Content Approval Business Logic**
```
Business Rule: Course Approval Process
- StatusID Management: Courses progress through Pending → Approved → Published states
- Approval Authority: Only administrators can approve courses via Approve(courseID, userID)
- History Tracking: SaveHistory() creates audit trail for all course modifications
- Practice Content: Separate approval for practice materials via practiceStatusID
```

#### **Course Existence Validation**
```
Business Logic: CheckExist(Course objCourse) and CheckExist(string title)
- Duplicate Prevention: System prevents duplicate course titles within same scope
- Title Uniqueness: Course titles must be unique to prevent student confusion
- Business Rule: Duplicate detection occurs at save time, not during creation
```

#### **Course History & Versioning**
- **Version Control**: `CheckHasCorseHistory(courseId)` determines if course has historical versions
- **History Creation**: `SaveHistory()` creates new version while preserving original
- **Rollback Capability**: `GetCourseNoHistory(id)` retrieves original version for rollback
- **Business Purpose**: Maintains content integrity while allowing iterative improvements

### 4.2 Content Sharing & Access Control

#### **Granular Sharing Permissions (ShareWith Enum)**
```
Business Logic: Course Access Control Matrix
ShareWith.World: Public access - all users can view
ShareWith.YourSchool: School-restricted - only same school members
ShareWith.YourStudent: Teacher-specific - only assigned students
ShareWith.YouOnly: Private - creator access only
```

#### **Access Validation Algorithm**
```
Business Rule: CheckCourseAccess(course, currentUser)
1. World Access: if (course.ShareID == ShareWith.World) return true
2. Owner Access: if (curUser.MemberID == course.CreatedUserID) return true
3. Admin Override: if (curUser.IsInRole(RoleGroup.AdminSuper)) return true
4. School Validation: if (ShareWith.YourSchool && curUser.SchoolOwnerID == creator.SchoolOwnerID) return true
5. Student Assignment: if (ShareWith.YourStudent && IsAssignedStudent()) return true
6. Private Content: if (ShareWith.YouOnly && curUser.MemberID != course.CreatedUserID) return false
```

#### **Cross-School Content Access**
- **School Boundary Enforcement**: `curUser.SchoolOwnerID != mem.SchoolOwnerID` blocks cross-school access
- **Teacher-Student Validation**: System validates teacher-student relationships for YourStudent content
- **Administrative Override**: School administrators can access teacher content within their school
- **SubAdmin Delegation**: SubAdmins inherit school-level content access permissions

### 4.3 Course Progress & Completion Tracking

#### **Most Recent Content Tracking**
```
Business Logic: UpdatedMostRecent(userID, courseID)
- Last Accessed: Tracks most recently viewed course per user
- Progress Continuation: Enables "continue where you left off" functionality
- Business Value: Improves user experience and course completion rates
```

#### **Course Navigation Logic**
```
Business Rule: Get(id, out nextId, out prevId)
- Sequential Navigation: Automatically determines next/previous course in sequence
- Prerequisite Enforcement: Next course access validated against completion requirements
- Learning Path Integrity: Maintains logical progression through course sequences
```

#### **Assignment Integration**
- **Homework Due Dates**: `HomeWorkDue` field integrates courses with assignment system
- **Time Requirements**: `TimeRequire` field sets expected completion time for planning
- **Assignment Linking**: `AssignmentID` connects courses to specific homework assignments
- **Progress Notes**: `Note` field captures teacher feedback and student progress observations

### 4.4 Content Quality & Standards Management

#### **Teacher Content Statistics**
```
Business Logic: GetTotalTeacherHasSong(userID, approvedStatus, deletedStatus, pendingStatus, songType, skillType, userRole)
- Content Portfolio Tracking: Monitors teacher content creation and approval rates
- Quality Metrics: Tracks approved vs pending content ratios
- Performance Analytics: Enables teacher performance evaluation and support
```

#### **Content Type Classification**
- **Song vs Skill Content**: System differentiates between musical pieces and technique instruction
- **Approval Workflows**: Different approval processes for different content types
- **Status Management**: Comprehensive status tracking (Approved, Deleted, Pending, Rejected)
- **Role-Based Creation**: Content creation permissions vary by user role and school policies

### 4.5 File Management & Media Integration

#### **File Upload & Processing**
- **File Encoding**: `FileEncode` field manages video/audio file processing status
- **Practice Files**: Separate `PracticeFileUpload` and `PracticeFileEncode` for practice materials
- **File Naming**: `PracticeFileNameUpload` preserves original file names for user reference
- **Storage Integration**: Seamless integration with cloud storage and CDN systems

#### **Multimedia Content Rules**
- **Format Standards**: Supported file formats defined by encoding capabilities
- **Quality Requirements**: Minimum quality standards for video and audio content
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum file sizes based on user role and school policies
