    schoolPaymentGateway = GetBySchoolId(schoolId)
    IF (schoolPaymentGateway.PaymentGatewayID > 0) THEN
        RETURN schoolPaymentGateway.PaymentGatewayID
    END IF
END IF

Tier 2 - Teacher-Level Fallback:
IF (teacherId > 0) THEN
    schoolOfTeacher = GetFirstSchoolOfTeacher(teacherId)
    IF (schoolOfTeacher.MemberID > 0) THEN
        schoolPaymentGateway = GetBySchoolId(schoolOfTeacher.MemberID)
        IF (schoolPaymentGateway.PaymentGatewayID > 0) THEN
            RETURN schoolPaymentGateway.PaymentGatewayID
        END IF
