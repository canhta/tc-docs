## Business Rules & Logic

### 1. Search Algorithm & Ranking Logic

#### **Relevance Scoring Algorithm**
```
Search Relevance Score = (Keyword Match × 0.4) + (User Context × 0.3) + (Content Quality × 0.2) + (Engagement Metrics × 0.1)

Components:
- Keyword Match: Exact matches, partial matches, semantic similarity
- User Context: Role, skill level, learning history, preferences
- Content Quality: Approval status, creator reputation, educational value
- Engagement Metrics: View count, completion rate, user ratings
```

**Business Rules**:
- Approved content receives 20% relevance boost over pending content
- User's skill level influences content ranking for educational appropriateness
- Recent content activity increases relevance for trending discovery
- Cross-school content requires higher relevance threshold for visibility

#### **Role-Based Search Filtering**
**Teacher Search Logic**:
- Access to all approved educational content within permission scope
- Student search limited to assigned classes and school enrollment
- Advanced filtering options for lesson planning and curriculum development
- Content creation history influences recommendation algorithms

**Student Search Logic**:
- Content filtered by enrollment status and skill level appropriateness
- Peer discovery limited by privacy settings and class membership
- Personalized recommendations based on learning progress and interests
- Practice material suggestions aligned with current assignments

### 2. Content Discovery & Recommendation Engine

#### **Personalized Recommendation Algorithm**
```
Recommendation Score = (Learning History × 0.35) + (Collaborative Filtering × 0.25) + 
                      (Content Similarity × 0.25) + (Trending Factors × 0.15)

Factors:
- Learning History: Completed courses, practice time, skill progression
- Collaborative Filtering: Similar users' preferences and behaviors
- Content Similarity: Genre, instrument, skill level, educational objectives
- Trending Factors: Popular content, recent additions, seasonal relevance
```

**Business Rules**:
- Recommendations must align with user's current skill level and learning objectives
- Content diversity maintained to prevent filter bubble effects
- Educational progression considered in recommendation sequencing
- Seasonal and event-based content promoted during relevant periods

#### **Content Access Validation Logic**
**ShareWith Permission Matrix**:
- **World (Public)**: Visible to all users regardless of school or role
- **YourSchool**: Visible only to members of the same school organization
- **YourStudent**: Visible only to enrolled students and their assigned teachers
- **YouOnly**: Visible only to content creator and authorized administrators

**Access Control Implementation**:
```csharp
// Simplified access control logic from SearchBll.cs
public bool ValidateContentAccess(long userId, int userRole, string shareWith, long contentCreatorId, long schoolId)
{
    switch (shareWith)
    {
        case "World": return true;
        case "YourSchool": return UserBelongsToSchool(userId, schoolId);
        case "YourStudent": return IsEnrolledStudent(userId, contentCreatorId) || IsAssignedTeacher(userId, contentCreatorId);
        case "YouOnly": return userId == contentCreatorId || IsAuthorizedAdmin(userId);
        default: return false;
    }
}
```
