// Basic variable substitution
personalizedContent = personalizedContent.Replace("{FirstName}", recipient.FirstName)
personalizedContent = personalizedContent.Replace("{LastName}", recipient.LastName)
personalizedContent = personalizedContent.Replace("{SchoolName}", GetSchoolName(recipient.SchoolOwnerID))

// Context-specific substitutions
FOR EACH kvp IN contextData DO
    personalizedContent = personalizedContent.Replace("{" + kvp.Key + "}", kvp.Value.ToString())
END FOR

// Conditional content processing
IF (recipient.IsInRole(RoleGroup.Student)) THEN
    personalizedContent = ProcessStudentSpecificContent(personalizedContent, recipient)
ELSE IF (recipient.IsInRole(RoleGroup.Parent)) THEN
    personalizedContent = ProcessParentSpecificContent(personalizedContent, recipient)
ELSE IF (recipient.IsInRole(RoleGroup.Teacher)) THEN
    personalizedContent = ProcessTeacherSpecificContent(personalizedContent, recipient)
END IF

// Localization
IF (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(recipient.PreferredLanguage)) THEN
